# CoderSwag
App displaying Swag for Coder utilizing RecyclerView, ListView and Kotlin Lamda functions

I have taken the CoderSwag-App from the project CoderSwag in the very good Android-Kotlin course on
Udemy by JonnyB from Devslopes.com 
https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-android-kotlin

This screenshot shows both the tablet and the phone view.
Notice that the tablet has one more column than the phone.

I will add some Unit tests to the project. For testing the recycler view and the adapter I will
use the know how given by this article
