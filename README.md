# CoderSwag - Android App written in Kotlin
App displaying Swag for Coder utilizing RecyclerView, ListView and Kotlin Lamda functions

I have taken the CoderSwag-App from the project CoderSwag in the very good Android-Kotlin course on
Udemy by JonnyB from Devslopes.com 
https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-android-kotlin

The app starts with the Category screen in which five categories of coder swag are shown.

Clicking on a category invokes an Intent which brings app into the Product screen.

This screenshot shows both the tablet and the phone view.
Notice that the tablet has one more column than the phone.

The following screenshot depicts the product in detail

I will add some Unit tests to the project. For testing the recycler view and the adapter I will
use the know how given by this article
